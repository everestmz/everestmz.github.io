title: Hi, I'm Everest
---


I'm building a stealth product at [Rippling](https://rippling.com).

Outside of work, I'm usually hacking on one of my personal [projects](/projects). Right now, I'm building AI-assisted programming tools like [sage](https://github.com/everestmz/sage) and [llmcat](https://github.com/everestmz/llmcat).

Previously, I dropped out of Waterloo to found Fuzzbuzz ([YC W19](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/fuzzbuzz)), where we built systems and tools to autonomously find software vulnerabilities. We served Fortune 100 companies and intelligence agencies, and were [acquired by Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/blog/founders-keepers-rippling-acquires-fuzzbuzz) in 2023.

Away from the keyboard, I regularly lift weights (nearly in the 1000lbs club), and enjoy cooking and baking dishes from scratch. I grew up in Singapore, have worked across North America and Europe, and now live in San Francisco.
