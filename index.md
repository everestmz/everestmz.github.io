#### I build products and systems from scratch, and solve problems at all layers of the stack.

Right now, I'm building a stealth product at [Rippling](https://rippling.com).

Outside of work, I hack on my [projects](/projects). Right now, I'm building AI-assisted programming tools like [sage](https://github.com/everestmz/sage) and [llmcat](https://github.com/everestmz/llmcat).

In **2019**, I founded **Fuzzbuzz** ([YC W19](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/fuzzbuzz)), where we built systems to autonomously find and triage software vulnerabilities via fuzz testing. We sold to Fortune 100 companies and intelligence agencies, many of whom still use our software, and were [acquired by Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/blog/founders-keepers-rippling-acquires-fuzzbuzz) in **2023**.

I studied CS at **Waterloo** for 3 years, interning on security eng. and dev tooling teams at **Coinbase**, **Google**, and **Shopify**, before dropping out to found Fuzzbuzz.

Away from the keyboard, I regularly lift weights (nearly in the 1000lbs club), and enjoy cooking and baking dishes from scratch. I grew up in Singapore, have worked across North America and Europe, and now live in San Francisco.
